                I'm a software engineer specializing in building exceptional websites.
                My interest in web development starting back in 2019 during my university. Turns out making CRUD operations
                for a semester project made me curious about the web industry.
                <br />
                Right now, I'm all about the frontend stack, rocking {highlightContainer("React")}, {highlightContainer("Next.js")}, and {highlightContainer("Typescript")}.
                I'm diving into {highlightContainer("React Native")} too, because who doesn't want to conquer the world of mobile apps? But that's not allâ€”I've also got some backend skills under my belt, including {highlightContainer("Node.js")}, {highlightContainer("Express")}, and {highlightContainer("GraphQL")}.
                I'm a well-rounded developer who knows how to handle the whole shebang.
