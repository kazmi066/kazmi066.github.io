                I'm a software engineer specializing in building exceptional websites.
                My interest in web development starting back in 2020 during my university - turns out making CRUD operations
                for a semester project made me curios about the web industry.
                <br />
                My focus right now is <b>React</b>, <b>Next</b> and <b>Typescript</b>.
                Might also try <b>React Native</b> someday.
                I also have experience with backend stuff including <b>NodeJs / Express</b> and <b>Graphql</b>.
